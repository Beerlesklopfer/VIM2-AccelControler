# VIM2-AccelControler

A Matlab App and Arduino Firmware to demonstrate the Acceleration af a rotary mass

This paper explains the context and structure of an experiment on rotational acceleration and its moment of
its section modulus. The use of a stepper motor in the mechanical experimental apparatus and the connection via
connection via Arduino with custom firmware allows the control of all parameters via Modbus. The experiment can be
controlled by a widget-based Matlab app via GUI. Experimental data is automatically generated, recorded
recorded and visually processed for the user. The asynchronous Modbus communication between App
and controller could not be realized error-free within the scope of this project. Any errors that occurred were
analyzed in detail and solutions were developed.
